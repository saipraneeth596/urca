# Terraform Project

This project is structured to manage infrastructure as code for multiple environments: Dev, QA, Staging, and Prod. Each environment has its own configuration files, allowing for tailored resource definitions and variable settings.

### Environments

- **Dev**: Contains the main Terraform configuration for the development environment.
- **QA**: Contains the main Terraform configuration for the quality assurance environment.
- **Staging**: Contains the main Terraform configuration for the staging environment.
- **Prod**: Contains the main Terraform configuration for the production environment.

### Modules

- **example_module**: A reusable module that can be utilized across different environments.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Terraform**: Ensure that Terraform is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. **Navigate to the Environment**: Change directory to the desired environment (e.g., `cd environments/dev`).

4. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.

5. **Plan the Deployment**: Execute `terraform plan` to see the resources that will be created or modified.

6. **Apply the Configuration**: Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the resources.

## Usage Guidelines

- Modify the `terraform.tfvars` file in each environment to set specific values for that environment.
- Use the `variables.tf` files to declare any additional variables needed for each environment.
- The `modules` directory can be used to define reusable components that can be shared across environments.
